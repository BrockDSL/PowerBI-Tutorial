# PowerBI-Workshop
## This tutorial outlines the basics of working in **PowerBI Online**. Feel free to work through this tutorial with the included Excel Workbook, or using any dataset you have

### Signing In and Main Page Overview
1. To get to PowerBI Online, open your web browser and head to [the PowerBI website](app.powerbi.com). From there, it'll prompt you to sign in with your Microsoft account. Use your Brock email and password to log in.

2. If you've worked in PowerBI recently, this is where you'll see all of your recent projects. You can favourite certain projects and they'll be shown in the top row along with projects that you work on frequently.
3. You'll also see some Microsoft recommended apps. PowerBI is designed with business numbers in mind including sales reports and  inventory counts, so PowerBI is recommending other business centered apps that are offered by Microsoft. The good news is that PowerBI can do much more than business numbers and sales graphs, which we'll see in a moment.
4. Finally, there are some video tutorials about how to use all of the different versions of PowerBI, including online, desktop, and mobile. Lucky you, you get to learn from the DSL instead of from Microsoft!

### Get Data
1. Unlike it's Desktop companion, PowerBI Online is slightly limited in where we can retrieve data. The desktop version allows information to be extracted from webpages, social media sites, and plenty of others. We do still have some options for data retrieval in PowerBI Online. Click **Get Data** in the bottom left hand corner of the window to see what these options are.
2. Here, we have the option to create new content, or to explore content from other members of our organization. To create new content, PowerBI Online gives us the option to connect to local files or to connect to an SQL Database. For this example, we're working with a local file, so navigate to the **Files** box under **Create New Content** and click **Get**.

3. From the options here, choose **Local File**, and then open the included exercise file (or any Excel/CSV file you'd like to visualize)
4. From here, we have the option to either **Import Excel Data into PowerBI** or to **Upload the Excel File to PowerBI**. If you wanted to make some edits to your data, you could do this by choosing the option on the right. However, choosing this option means that if you want to visualize the data later, you'll have to create a separate file. We want to create visualizations for our data, so we're going to **choose the option on the left - Import Excel Data into PowerBI**

5. Now, we should be in report view. This is where we'll start creating visualizations about our data.

### Creating Basic Visualizations in PowerBI
1. Deciding what kind of visualization you want to create really depends on what kinds of discoveries you want to make about your data. You'll find that this becomes easier when you're working with your own data rather than an excercise file. For now, we'll stick to our exercise file - let's say we want to visualize the winning/losing rates of the four football teams who have won the most Super Bowls.
2. In the fields tab, we can see our two datasets: **Super Bowl Game Details** and **Super Bowl Appearances by Team**. For this visualization, we'll use the second of these two datasets.

3. Tables are the easiest visualization to create in PowerBI, and it's a nice way to be able to see your data while you're creating more complex
